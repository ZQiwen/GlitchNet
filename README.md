# GlitchNet: glitch detection and removal algorithm based on deep learning methods

## Glitch detection:

Put your Input miniSEED files in **Input** and run **detect.py**, the output glitch catalogs are saved in **catalog**.

## Glitch removal:

Run **deglitch.py**, the deglitched mimiSEED files are saved in **Output.**

You can change the settings for plotting in **paras.py** to speed up processing.
